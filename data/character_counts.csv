Always that same public is warn ed to be on the lookout for all such frauds. Yet meanwhile, the very people who are most on the alertare being methodically fleeced and consistently trimmed by the surefire operators who specialize in the shortchange game. This hidden racket, without doubt takes as great an annual toll as all the other combined. The tenfold is the name given the fanciest of all shortchange, artifices. As well as fanciest, it is the rarest The reason It can only be work ed around places where hundred dollar bills are common, such as ritzy nightclubs, bigtime gambling joints, or the swankier resort. hotels. After establishing confidence by his casual handling of thufdred , dollar bills, the short changer begins passing tenspots which he has folded so that the number 100 shows instead. He creases back the left edge of the bill, alongside the zero of the 10 in the upper comer. He carries that crease over to right, covering the figure one of the 10 in the upper tight. In this case, ten plus zero equals one hundred, to all appearances. The swindler then folds the bulk of the bill underneath, bending the lower portion up and under. Press ing his thumb just below the top figures, he holds the bill folded so that. it appears to be a hundredspot. If he habitually handles bills in this fashion, the swindler can frequently fool a night club cashier when paying a large tab, or can get by with it at a gambling joint when buying chips. It's all done with a casual flash that imprints 100"" on the mind of the person receiving the bill. Nervy though it is, the ruse has a strong element of safety. Only after unfolding the bill will the cashier discover it to be a ten and then the evidence in the form of the tricky fold, is no longer in. existence! A different sort of fold. is used in every day life. Here, the short changer is usually a man behind a counter or concession booth. When he gives nine dollars change for a tenspot, to complete a on dollar sale, he counts off nine dollars, yall in ones. But the customer gets only seven bills, not nine, Two of the bills are folded in half and inter spersed. among the others. They are placed so that their loose ends all point the same way, The short changer keeps his thumb across the center of the little pile, thus holding the folded bills in place. This enables him to count nine bills instead of seven, by lifting the bills at the end where two of them are doubled. Thus two of the bills are counted twice, although all seems perfectly fair. Most, operators have a neat trick of inserting their fingers among the folds and straightening the doubled bills while passing the batch to the customer. The victim spends his money, wonder ing how a couple of extra bucks went so fast, never realizing that he was gypped of them tc begin with! This is one way of having your mohey doubled, only to find that you have less! Naturally, the trick can be worked both ways. Often, short change artists use. the fold when making purchases. at stores and some even add a twist of stealing one bill froma normal stack, while spreading it. But a careful clerk can put the skids under such chicanery. If he counts the money before putting it in the cash register, the customer will have to apologize for a mistake. and make up the difference. This so hurts the pride of some gyp artists, that they reso. t to the split bill system, which, has its dangers, as it involves tampering with US. currency, but is seldom spotted, Even then, it allows the hustler a chance to pose as an innocent party who had some funny money pass ed on him without his knowledge. The story goes that the split bill came into vogue when some sharper soaked a Bank of England note in water and found that it came apart as two bills, each with printing showing on both sides. This was corrected so that British bills would be blank on one side if split in such fashion and the same is true of U. S. money,",Drama,0,"The tenfold is the name given the fanciest of all shortchange, artifices.

Here, the word brain is, of ee, used loosely. But it infers that this brain is a good one, welltrained, and able to think along logical and constructive lines. As far back as mankind goes, the combina tion of men, brains and curiosity has ac counted for the progress of our civilization. In the days of the cave men, the man who was bested by his enemy from across the canyon began to feel very angry about the thing. T cant lick that big fellow because hes too strong for me, said the loser of the bout. But I wonder what I can do about the situa tion? So this primitive scientist sat down and thought it over. He had a brain. He was curious to know something. So while he was sitting there outside his cave, his eyes came to rest on a length of wood . . . a section of a lightningstruck tree, perhaps. E Now if 1 took thar stick, said the cave man to himself, and held it in my hand and beat about me with it, would have a distinct advantage over my enemy! HIS, he did. And by using this weapon he was able to conquer his enemy. Here, hypothetically, we have an example of the first, crude application of the BrainsPlus Curiosity formula to the progress of science! x Scientific Progress The same examplesmuch more highly advancedcan be found today almost every where you look. A fewshort years ago, for instance, hand irons were heated over wood burning stoves. Someone began to get curious about irons. Why not an electric iron? he wondered. It wasn't very long until we had electric irons. But it didnt stop with that. Someone else began to wonder why you had to use a damp cloth to press certain materials. Why not incorporate the dampening agent right in the iron itself, thus eliminating the irksome task of applying damp cloths to the material to be pressed? Why not, indeed! And so today we have the electric iron that can be used filled with water as a combination dampenerandironer. There are thousands of other examples millions of examplesof this advancement of scientific thought by the unbeatable combina tion of brains and curiosity. Otis with his firse practical elevator is one. Marconi and his wireless see SCIENCE Comics No. 1 is another. De Forrest with his cathode ray tube the basis of television is a third. We could go on and on, recalling other instances of this application of brains and curiosity to the furtherance of science and therefore of human existence in general. In fact, today it is not even a matter of recall ing . .. a glance at the daily paper will invariably bring one more new example to your attention! wy ia",Action,0,"In the days of the cave men, the man who was bested by his enemy from across the canyon began to feel very angry about the thing.

Today, such sessions as. those would make very laughable material for topflight comic strips or motion picture comedies. For ex ample, one group of 'scientists had quite a good many meetings to discuss, of all things, the approximate number of angels that could gather on the head of a common pin! These men were very serious about this thing, and their arguments waxed hot and heavy. Some of them claimed that angels were suchandsuch a size and this group was opposed by those who held that angels were larger than that . . . or smaller than that. Now, this is not a farfetched example of the kind of scientific folderol that went on in those days. On the contrary, it is a very typical case and entirely true. In England, only a few generations ago, a meeting of a learned society gathered together for the purpose of examining certain scien tific facts. One of the subjects on the agenda was a discussion of the number of teeth in a horse's mouth, It happened that this meeting was open to the public, and so there was a goodly gather ing of citizens in the balcony of the hall. As the arguments of these great men waned and flowed, a young man in the group of spec x ee By Joseph tators became increasingly restless. After several hours of heated discussion during the course of which all sorts of reasons were advanced to prove that horses had twenty teeth or thirty teeth or thirtytwo teeth the young fellow in the balcony had reached the end of his rope. Leaping to his feet, he amazed the assem bled citizenryto say nothing of the scientists by suddenly shouting For heavens sake, if you want to know how many teeth there are in a horses mouth, why dont you find a horse, open his mouth and count them! This type of thinking was such a shock to the scientists and to their scientific dignity, that they ordered the young man ejected from the meeting! ODAY, with our modern scientists smash ing atoms and bouncing radar waves off the moon, such goingson appear entirely ridiculous and insane. Yet, those earlier scien tists were using the basic ingredients of scientific research brains and curiosity. Their only mistake lay in tackling a. problem which did not exist in the case of the angels on the head of a pin and in merely theorizing in the case of the horse's teeth. For it is an axiom that when a given man develops an interestthat is to say, grows curiousabout a given thing, the wheels of scientific progress automatically begin to turn.

When the mighty Georgia football eleven of 1942 was blast ing its way to top national honors, its spectacular back, Frankie Sinkwich, was blasting to the top of all sports pages with sensational headlines. What many people did not know was that a good part of Sinkwichs success was due to the bruising work done by George Poeschner, an end, and Frankie's closest friend. In fact, Frank refused to go to Georgia unless the school also accepted Gradual football people began to realize that, it was George with his unusual ability to catch forward passes, run interference, and take out wouldbe tacklers who was spreading glory roses in Frankies path. When Georgia went on to the Rose Bow! and won, George was content to stay in the background and let his pal take the glory. Then the war came, and George went into the army, to play in a bigger game. He was shot in the head and for three days lay unconscious in no mans land. When they found him, hope for his recovery was slight. But, George came through. Again, he got no headlines.

A great deal of zing as gone out of his pitches. Nonetheless, Bob Feller is still tops. Realizing that his fast ball is not what it used to be, Bob thas begun to use a sharp curve more and more. One of the deeds that Feller is especially proud of is his breaking of Rube Waddells atelleorcant record of 347. In a 1936 game, when Bob was first starting up the road to fame, Leo Durocher was batting against Feller. Rapid Robert burned two fast strikes down the middle which almost tore Leos eyebrows off. As Feller wound up for the third pitch, Leo laid down his bat and walked away. You have another strike coming, said the umpire. No, thanks, said the trembling Durocher, I dont want it.

I was pretty much ef a kid then, and still kinda puffed up over the way my nice new Navy uni form fit me snug across the hips and broad across the shoulders. But to listen to the neighbors, youd have thought something momentous was in the wind, instead of just little old Pudge Proc tor going off to win the war for Uncle Sam. Mrs. Dewey, who lived next door, came over clucking something fearful, and she patted my mother consolingly on the shoulder. Dont worry, Elizabeth, she said. Hell come back a better man for the experienee. The Navy does things for growing boys, you know. Gives them poise, and bearing, and discipline. Mrs. Barringer, from across the street, wasnt any better. You'll like the Navy, Pudge, she chuckled. My husband was in the Navy in the last war, and he says it did him a world of good. What kind of good was it supposed to do me? Thats what I wanted to know. What was I, be fore I got in the Navya juvenile delinquent or something? I figured Id led a pretty blameless life, but after that better man routine, I be gan to wonder a little. Matter of fact, after three years running a blipboxthats a radar detectoraboard a bat tleship, and then coming back to my prewar job as a copy boy for the local paperTHE CLARIONI was still wondering what good the Navy did for me. Sure, we won the war and all that, but Im still Pudge Proctor, and I dont see that Ive gotten any more poise, bearing or discipline out of the deal. I did get a promotion, though. Just the other day I got hiked a step up to fullfledged reporter and got a letter of commendation from the F. B. I. besides. And maybe it all ties in with the better man the Navy is supposed to have made out of me. Im not too sure, but you read on, and I'll let you be the judge. It started a week and a half ago, when things were going pretty fast down at the CLARION office. We had three men out covering the Mayors speech at City Hall, and another reporter was covering the case of Mrs. Barringers lost diamond brooch, and that left little old yours truly holding down the office all by his lonesome. Of course. City Editor Johnny Kane was there, but he wasn't helping me much with my job of empty ing the inkwells, changing typewriter ribbons or cleaning up wastebaskets, so we dont count him! At about 3 o'clock that afternoon, the phone PORTS rings and Johnny answers it. I can hear him talking, pretty disinterestedlythen all of a sud den his ears perk up and he starts chewing hard er on the cigar in his mouth. Yeah . . Yeah. .. . he barks excitedly. Thanks for the tip. .. I'll get somebody over there right away. He hangs up and looks around the office with a blank stare. Gosh, Pudge, I forgot, says he. I dont have anybody here except YOU! Gee, thanks, I grumble. And Im just a hunk of furniture, I suppose. Maybe you could handle it at that, he grins. It's a chance every copy boy dreams of. I re member when I was a copy boy, years ago. .. But never mind that. Get your hat and coat on, and meet the 410 train coming in from New York City. Theres a guy coming in on it, who just landed in New York yesterday from France. Name's Monsieur Pierre Lejeune, and from what he spilled to the press boys in New York, he was quite a hotshot in the French Resistance during the war. Hes coming over here to in spect a few munitions plants so he can help put the French defense plans on a modern footing. What am I supposed to do? I grinned, reach ing for my coat and a pad of paper, Give him the benefit of my extensive military knowledge three years behind a blipbox? Don't crack wise, he chuckles. .He must have a sleeve full of exciting stories about what went on in France during the war. Draw him out, and maybe we can slap together a good human interest story. One of the defense plants hes gonna discuss is right here in our townthe Willoughby torpedo plant. So get hopin, kid, and lets see what kind of a story you bring back. Make it good enough, and you'll be a fullfledged reporter by tomorrow. After todays experience, I guess I can use another one, anyway. With that for an incentive, I shot out of the office like a destroyer out of a mineinfested area, This was my big chance, and I was determined not to muff it. Dont misunderstand the way I kid around with the City Editor. Its just that he and I have worked together for so long that I can get away with things. He knows Im not being smart aleckthats why he gave me this big chance when it came up. I hopped into my jaloppy, and clattered along down Main Street till I came to the train depot. There was hardly anybody on the platform, and I realized that I still had half an hour before this Frenchmans train came in. So I spent the time figuring out just what I was going to ask him, COnT'D om PIB",Fantasy,0,Error generating caption,non-spoiler,,,,,,,

Then the gyps found a way to work it. Their system was to split bills of two denominations, like a Batch of ones and another group of fives. They then glued the fives and ones back to back. The result was a bill that showed a five on one side and one on the other. Ashort changer, armed with such bills, goes into a store and makes a purchase totalling eighteen dollars. He brings out three five dollar bills and three singles, counting them quite care fully, but letting them get mixed say, first a five, then two ones, pair of fives and finally an odd single. He hands these to. the clerk who rcounts them, maybe separating them at the same time, but finding nothing wrong with the amount. One of the fives however, is a double facer, showing a five on one side, a one on the other. Such a bill is worth only three dollars, since a pair of them are formed from a five and a one. hus the clerk has collected fifteen in stead of eighteen dollars. If he happens to turn over the bills while putting them in the cash register, they still appear as genuine currency and he is not likely to note the difference in the ameunt. The short changer usually does something to divert the victim's attention. at any crucial stage of the deal. As with all trickery it's a case of getting people to look close when there is nothing phoney to be observed then coaxing them into a careless. mood when arrives, Around carnivals or amusement parks, the take it or leave it system is in vogue, when the customers, as its mame implies, the customer gets a chance to take it if he wishes. the short changer pushes some coins forward, after giving them a very fair and accurate count. He does this near a large pile of change that is lying loose on the counter. As he pushes the money, he deftly separates it into two groups, one going to the ticket buyer, the rest remain ing close to the big pile. The victim takes the group nearest him, not realizing the rest of the change is his also. Should he count it and return to beef over the pinch it, the short changer gestures to a few. odd coins and snaps you take i This system is a favorite with ticket sellers who have a window booth, particularly the sort with a metal crossbar or a wicket. They can pick just the right angle to place the extra coins io a spot where the customer does not see them That must be yours. Why didnt countet man wants to hang a gyp on his when he gathers up his change. If he comes back, he wonders why he didnt see it all along and never thinks to blame the ticket seller. If you ask the average person to give you change for a five dollar bill, he will invariably hand you four ones, then count out a dollar's worth of change. In ticket booths, the opposite procedure isusual. The Selter counts out the silver, pushes it to the customer, and brings up the bills from beneath the counter. Ticketsellers seldom are in a hurry, but purchasers often rush away. Naturally, the seller cant climb through the window and run after them. Maybe he doesnt intend to shortchange them and as a matter of fact, he never would if he paid out the bills first and the small change last. However, that fortn of the take it or leave it allows no chance of a protest by the custom er. Itis surpassed only by the system used at shooting galleries, or other counters where the customer is busy with some sort of game while his money is being changed. The operator simply puts the coins on the counter and forgets them, hoping the victim will do likewise. Such counters are usually decorated with nice alum inum paint which happens. purely by coinci dence, to match coins made of silver and nickel. Since the paint looks so nice, the proprietor always brushes or wipes the counter after the customers walk away. It is really, surprising how often he comes across coins there! It is the ease with which the short changer can be worked that has built it into Americas biggest swindle that, plus the factor stated earlier Volume of business. After all, everybody changes money dozens of times a day, so the opportunities for such gyps are many. Sales of stocks and oilwells, payments on insurance claims, even transactions involving bank checks, are infinitesimal, when compared with the handling of actual. .currency. What's more, people are often on guard when they buy or sell but they pay little attention to the matter of making change. Though it is only petty graft where the in dividual is concerned, short changing is being worked by so mary smallfry gyp artists that its total assumes gigantic proportions. By. watching out for shortchangers, you can save your money if you count it yourself! Don't let them do that for you. Its their own particular specialty, a Above all, remember that the real experts in this type of swindle have pet tricks of their own and switch methods before the customer can catch up with them. g THE END",Action,0,Error generating caption,non-spoiler,,,,,,,

When the village fires haveibeen bank ed for the night, and the jungle is silent save for the occasional cough of a lion in the brush, the native mothers will gather their children to them, ' and gesture out into the night toward the sound of the lion. Beware, they will say sternly. ""Do not wan der an the, jungles in, the darknessand you Y among my sons who will grow up to be great hunters and warriors, take care at whom you cast your deadly spears. For it may be the ghost of Pavlovic and he might nied you down 1n his anger. Then, ohil the lowering fires cast ionnge shadowsupon the jungle trees, she will tell them the story of R'wana and Ngobi, the two hunters, and Blina, the pretty girl who was loved by the both of them. And the children, though they have heard the story many times, will shudder as. they is a good storyand they w member it and when they have children of th r own, they will repeat the story to them, just as they heard it In. this manner, the story of the ghost of R'wana has been told among the Kenya people for many generations. R'wana and Ngobi were the two greatest hunt ers among the Kenya peoplethis was many moons agoand their prowess with the hunting spear was known far and wide across their land. Far and wide, also, was the fame of Blina, daughter of the chieftain of the Kenya people, whose beauty was said to be greater than any in the whole land. Now fn the earl of Ngob the Hine there was, always sunshine. He sang to himself as ne followe the. peeeeye of the jungle, and he eng was little of sunshine or laughter. When Rwana wefit forth to hunt, there was grimness and anger in his heart, and scarcely a day would pass but he would bring back more than enough dead animals to feed his portion of the village. When Ngobi killed only for food, twas said that Rwana killed for the joy of killingand that is always a bad thing. There was great rivalry between R'wana and Ngobinot only in their hunting, but also for favor in the eyes of the beautiful Blina. To be the most beautiful girl in the village might in itself have been enough to cause them to fall in love with Blina. But when she was the daughter of the chieftain besides. .. ah' For it was known well. among the Kenya people that the chieftain had no sons. The man who married Blina would some day rule all, the Kenya country Between Ngob and, R'wana, all the village knew that Blina preferred the gifts and smiles of Ngobi to those of R wana, But among the Kenya people, the, father. picks the husband of his daughter, and there were none among the Kenya people who could guess which of the two men the chief preferred. , But R'wana, whose heart was black, was afraid He feared that Blinas father preferred Ngobi for her husband. The prospect of having Ngobi be come chieftain of all the Kenya people instead of himself was too much for Rwanas pride And so, when the black lon came to the Kenya jungles, R'wana decided to put the matter to a test. He called Ngobi to him, and together they went to see the chieftain. O. chief, said R'wana proudly I wish to propose a test to decide which of us shall be come the husband of the beautiful Blina. For , many nights now, we have heard the coughing o the great black lion in our jungles Some night he may swoop down upon our village and kull Our cattle or attack our. people It is my wish",Action,0,R'wana and Ngobi were the two greatest hunt ers among the Kenya people.

But then I remembered that all we knew about him. hed told to the newspaper reporters in New York, so I guessed he was able to talk our language a little, any way. About ten minutes before the train pulled in, up came a jeep with STARPRESS plastered all over its side doors. Out popped Shorty Smith, the photographer for our rival paper in town, and with him was Chuck Hardin, one of STAR PRESSs regular reporters. They both grinned when they saw me there. Well, well, laughed Chuck. So the CLARION finally decided to send a boy on a mans errand, eh? I let ""em laugh. What was the good of arguing? I knew he was half right. I wouldnt have been there if a regular reporter had been available. Just the same, I aimed to show them a thing or two. Well, right on the dot, Monsieur Lejeunes train train rolled into town, and Chuck, Shorty and I nailed him before his foot hardly touched the platform. He seemed a little peeved to see us, but I put that down to the trouble he had with our lan guage. His English, to say the least, was barely understandable. T glad to see you, he said. No statement for press, sil vous plait. Ver beezy . .. We wouldnt let him brush us off that easily. Finally he consented to let us have a short inter view. But no pictures, he said, eyeing Shortys camera coldly. Flash bulbs scare! Shorty glow ered, but rather than risk losing a story, he put his camera aside. Chuck went right to work, ignoring me as if I weren't there at all. This got me mad, so I shoved forward, and brandished my pad and pencil in my best professional manner. Tl try to keep my stuff short, Mr. Lejeune, I grinned, elbowing my way past Chuck. I know all about who you are and why you're here from the New York paper. What Id like to know is what was your most memorable adventure during the war? His eyes lit up as if that was one question he really would enjoy answering. He turned his back on Chuckdid my chest start to puff out! and devoted his full attention to me, It really come. after war, not during war, he said haltingly. After German retreat from Paris, we find much gold is gone from City Bank. We know. German leave town too fast to take with him, so we know gold hidden somewhere in Paris. But wherethat is puzzle? I am put in charge, as captain in Resistance movement, of finding lost gold. I have my men out day and night, searching all Paris. No gold. All look hopeless. Then I get idea. My idea to search bottom of Seine River. Once before. during FrancoPrussian War in 1800's, fleeing Germans dump loot iin Seine River before retreating. The Boche, I know, never change his habits. Perhaps he has dump this gold in river, too. Oh boy, Chuck broke in. This is gonna make a dilly of a yarn. Nice question, kid. Lejeune smiled at him, and turhed back to me with his story. I go to French Navy offices, he said, and borrow portable radar set from them. I mount radar set on barge, and put two Navy men aboard to operate set. Then off we go to take radar search of Seine River. We go all way from mouth to upper end of city. Finally, radar set start sending back signals. I get all excite . .. Yell like crazy for digger boat. Soon digger boat come along, drop electric shovel down to river bottom, bring up lots of mud. Not only lots of mud, but huge cases of iron. When we open cases . GOLD. I could see Chuck Hardins pencil flying as he took down every word of this priceless narrative. Me, I had heard enough. I thanked Mr. Lejeune for his courtesy, and got out of there in my jaloppy as fast as I could. I hightailed it back to the office and spilled the whole thing to Johnny Kane. Kane almost climbed through the roof and when he pulled himself together again, he got on the long distance phone to Washington in no time at all. Which is how the CLARIONthats mescoop ed the wings off the STARPRESS, and how I got myself promoted to full reporter and got a citation from the F. B. I. to boot. Because I had spotted a very phoney line in our friend Lejeunes little fairy tale. The minute he started handing me a story about using a radar set to find anything at the bottom of a river, I smelled a rat. Take it from an old blip box admiral, radar waves do NOT penetrate be low water. You have to use SONAR, or sound waves, for that. A munitions expert should have known better than that, so I suspected our friend Lejeune of being a phoney right then and there. When a search of F. B. I. files confirmed my sus picions that he was no representative of France, but was instead suspected of being a foreign spy, the F. B. I. went right to work on him. He didnt inspect the Willoughby torpedo plant, or any place else except the inside of a jail cell. Thanks to being in the Navy, I had all this happen to me.

As we retraced our steps back to my studio, Anta reminded be of the appoint ments. I had By the tim we get back you should have been connected with Dr. Hota Jardeza on Venus, After that, you are to see the ambassador from Mars, my uncle, Theo Raska, As we entered my studiol heard the buzzer announce that contact had been made on channel five. Anta moved the quartz tridi mensional screen to my chair and opened the contact switeh. A smal man seated at a table appeared at my side. . Greetings, my colleague, he began. It is good to see you again. We discharged the last of our cases yesterday and thanks to you our planet is again free from the dreaded disease. Next March we are going to hold our Scientific Conference in our capital city. We would. be highly honored if you would attend and giv us the results of your recent studies on teeth. How is your brilliant pupil? If she is present, then my compliments to her for her excellent paper on Gyroscopie Vibrations. We were using a oneway beam projection setup so that while I could see and hear Dr. Jardeza, he could only hear me talk. I fin ished the last case in the Isolation Ward. I have wonderful news for you. In case of my death, or incapacity, you have been chosen by the Council on Science to be the next guardian of Dr. Maguns formula, I'll attend that Conference of yours and give you fur ther details and what you will be expected to do with the formula. Anta is at my side and She probably will have something to say. My Martian pupil moved to the speaker unit. My studies here are finished and by Jaw I soon will have to return to my planet. My uncle should be here any minute. As though anticipating her very words and thoughts a message appeared on the Tele type Screen The Ambassador from Mars is here to see you, Dr. Walker. I leaned over to the speaker. Sorry to cut our talk short, Dr. Jardeza. I'll call you back tomor row morning. , Theo Raska entered. Offhand, one might say he was about 150 years old, judging in terms of earth years. He carried himself with ease and grace, And like all Martians, his skin was milky white and he was exceed ingly tall. Because of his rank, he was per mitted to wear a close cut chin beard. He was allsmiles as we exchanged greets ings. I am going to leave you ina hurry, he announced They are holding my space ship for me at the interplanetary field. In view of your work with Dr. Maguns for mula, the Senate of Mars has voted without a single dissenting vote to reward you. We know that in the past you have given all gifts of money to further the work of your research. You may ask for something only for yourself. Anything you wish. Regardless of cost of what it may be. I was conscious of the increased rate of my heart beat as my mind searched for the. proper words for an answer. I thought 1 saw Anta tremble a bit. Something unusual for a Martian. I would like to ask Anta to be my wife, I began. That is impossible because under your law she can only remain here for two years They say that there are exceptions to every rule. Make this exception for me. Theo didit blink an eyelid as he rales T hope you twowill be happy. Since that is what you wish, lam empowered to gratit it. He bade us farewell and a smile appeared on his face. My niece is certainly a far looking lady to get me to work out a way by which she could remain with you. We took the elevator to the observation tower. There we could see the universe and Theos space ship as it left the field. Anta looked at me. I know the secret of Dr. . Maguns formula, she softly said. One day I broke a vial of that precious fluid. So I analyzed it. Only distilled water! Yet it works miracles! The woman who was to be my wife was the only person outside of myself who knew thecontents of each vial of that fluid. When I died or was incapacitated, Dr. Jardeza would carry on my work. .I knew she ex pected me to tell her something, Dr. Magun was a wonderful man. He knew that sickness was one of the mind. Not really caused by any germ. Yet if people thought they could be cured, they would be cured. Because of what he did we have prac tically wiped out the curse of Hate from this world, from this known Universe. And when from time to time, we get some cases of it, we know how to handle Hate in a scientific manner.",Action,0,Error generating caption,spoiler,,,,,,,

The Council of Science had asked me to study the problem of the de creasing size of human teeth. From the Na tional Archives, mierofilms and microrec ords had been sent to me for my personal use, It was only when I flicked the switch on the machine that I became aware of the presence of Anta Mextacas. She was tal like all Martians and her Skin was milky white. She handed me my energy tablet. At the rate you are going, Dr. Walker, she commented, Ill have to in ' rease your dose by at least fifty percent. Perhaps my answer was a bit unfair. Since when does the pupil tell the master what to do? She pouted a bit and then re gained perfect control of herself. Im sorry for saying that, she apologized. I guess lately I havent been myself. I received my notice that I must return to Mars by No vember first. How quickly the two years had passed. I remember the first day that Anta had come to my famous research laboratory to study under me. In a plaretwide contest she had been chosen as the most brilliant student in Mars. Her reward was a scholarship. The law of Mars was inflexible. The maximum time that any of its subjects could remain on any other planet was twentyfour months. Anta reminded me. You havent seen George Persons in the Isolation Ward, I gave him his last injection of Dr. Maguns for mula yesterday. .Hes beon asking for you. All over the universe they have been talking af how you have checked the cases with the formula, i S As 1 arose from my seat, 1 smiled. 1 really deserve no credit for what is hap pening. After all am only the guardian of Dr, Maguns formula. Remember what he did in 1985? As we walked down the long corridor to the Isolation Ward, Anta answered. I guess every child in the universe knows that fa mous story. I think I was about five when my father told it to me, It was after World War Ill when Dr. Magun felt it was time that something be done to check the disease that had threatened to destroy Warth. He announced his famous formula Hydro chlolorsextine. How seeptieal people were in those days! But the brave few took the ine jections. After all, what alternative did they have? Complete annihilation or the prick of a needle? And when they were saved, the word spread like wildfire. Later when con tact was made with other planets in the uni verse it was learned that some of their in habitants were also infected with the dreaded disease. Vials of the precious fluid were sent on those first primitive space ships. The universe is what it is today because of the work of one earthling Dr. William Magun. An electric ye swung open a large steel door that led to the Isolation Ward. We stopped in front of a guard who greeted, 1 am sure the patient has recovered. He told me this morning that he was his old self again and grateful for what you did to help him. The guard unlocked the door and we three entered a large room. A middle aged man, in about his late nineties, arose from a chair in which he had been resting. I just talked with my wife and child on the video screen, he said, and they are waiting for meat home. I told them T was cured. What I said to himwas exactly what J had said to all the other patients in the Ward who suffered the same dreaded disease. Are you certain that it will not recur again and take control of you? And he, like all the other patients, responded in the same man",Action,0,Dr. Walker was sent to Mars by the Council of Science to study the problem of the de creasing size of human teeth.

The first of us to seek out and kill the black lion shall become the husband of your daughter. At this Ngobi. raised his hand in protest. This is not a good test, he said. It is well known among our people that a lion does not attack a man unless he has first been attackedor if he has been hurt and cannot find his food among the beasts of the jungle. By this test, if Rwana and I fail to kill the black lion, we shall turn him into a mankiller. The chieftain was silent for a moment and then he gave his decision. It is a good test, he said. You are both mighty hunters. One of you is sure to succeed, even if the other fails. Tomorrow you shall take your spears and go together into the jungle. The first to kill the black lion onal wed my daughter. Line he Thus, over Neobi's protests, the test was set. The next day the two mighty hunters left the village together, and set out into the jungle to discover the spoor of the great black lion. Ngobi was not long in coming upon it. They followed it together, until they came to a water hole by a river, and there they found the lion, ee to drink his fill, At the sight of the lion, Ngobi could not bring himself to loose his spear. But there was no such qualm in the heart of Rwana. With a happy shout, he let his spear fly through the air. It Janded on the haunch of the lion. With a mighty roar, tHe beast shook it loose, and limped off into the jungle, with the blood streaming from his crippled leg. Why did you not kill him once I had missed? demanded Rwana. He has not harmed me, Beige Ngobi, and there is no need of food in our village. It would have been a senseless kill, and my heart said no. Rwana laughed, and called Ngobi coward, and when they returned to the village he told the story to all the people, and insisted that because Ngobi had not killed the lion, or even tried to do so, it proved that Ngobi did , not love the beautiful Blina. But Ngobi said nothing, and re tired to his hut in silence. When the people heard that Rwana had wound ed the black lion, but had not killed him, there was a great fear and anger among them. They said Of R'wana. that the lion would turn mankiller in Tevenge and they shouted at Rwana and threw stones at him, and drove him into his hut in disgrace. There he sat and brooded upon the failure of his planand there he hatched a new plan. Come nightfall, he would sneak into the hut of Blina and carry her off into the jungle. He would refuse to bring her back to the village until the chieftain promised her to him as a wife. That night, he ventured out of his hut and started across the compound toward the hut of Blina. , His mind was so upon his evil errand that he did not see the great black shape that hid in the shadows, and he did not hear oe, roar of the black lion until it was too late. A scream escaped from his lips, and then Rwana went down under the sldshing claws of the powerful beast. 4 Bs , The roar and the scream brought shouts from . the huts, and out bounded Ngobi with his spea in his hand. Bravely he faced the snarling lord of the jungle. Now at last he could kill with a clear conscience. Now his village was under at tack. He drew back his arm, and let his spear fly. ' ye The titek were kind to his spear, for it shee home, and the lion toppled dead in the dust across the body of R'wana. ih hi The entire village came to stand in awe it the size of the black lion, and they all marveled at the bravery of Ngobi and the power in his arm that drove the spear into so great a beast. And there was a hearty shout of approval from alF and a tender smile from Blinawhen the chief announced that he would abide by the pledge he had made. Since Ngobi had killed the black lion, Ngobi should marry Blina, and become the next chieftain of the Kenya people. Rwana did not live to hear of his defeat. The tellers. of tales would have it that his ghost mingled with the ghost of the great black lion . until they became one. Together, so the legend '. runs, the ghost of Rwana and the ghost of the lion he turned into a mankiller roam the Kenya jungles. And both their hearts are black with anger, and both have a great hate for the Kenya people. "" And that is wie when a lion coughs in the nighttime jungle, the children of Kenya shud der, and listen to the tale of the man who caused his own death because there was nothing but hate in his heart.
